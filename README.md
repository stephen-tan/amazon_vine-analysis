# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze reviews of the Amazon Vine (paid review) program to determine if there was bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members compared to unpaid regular reviewers. We were tasked to select a dataset based on reviews of a specific product; for this analysis, I chose to analyze furniture products. In order to complete the analysis, I had to perform an ETL process to extract, transform, and load the data by connecting to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database (RDS) and then load the transformed data into pgAdmin.<br/>
